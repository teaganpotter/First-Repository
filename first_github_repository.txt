Although I am completely new to the programming world, I love how technology can assist in making our everyday lives easier. While the initial work associated with creating a program can be immense, a finished program can ultimately alleviate the programmer or user from doing repetitive, menial tasks on a daily basis. As the programmer, I personally love how each program and function presents a challenging logic puzzle that needs to be figured out. No two programmers will write approach a problem in exactly the same manner; therefore, learning to code creates a unique team-based environment in which each programmer brings a different asset to the comprehensive whole.
